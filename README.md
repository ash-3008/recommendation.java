# 🎬📚 Recommendation System in Java

A **console-based Recommendation Engine** developed using core Java.  
This project allows users to explore **personalized content suggestions** — *Movies*, *WebSeries*, and *Books* — based on **genre** and **language preferences**.

📁 It uses a preloaded **CSV dataset** to simulate real-world recommendation filtering.

> 🎯 *Ideal for Java beginners* to practice file handling, OOP, CLI interaction, and filtering logic.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Dynamic CSV Parsing** – Reads content directly from `data.csv`  
✅ **Robust CLI Interface** – Clean and interactive command-line experience  
✅ **Smart Filtering** – Recommends content based on:

- 📂 **Content Type** – `Books`, `Movies`, `WebSeries`
- 🎭 **Genre** – e.g., `Thriller`, `Romance`, `Comedy`, etc.
- 🌐 **Language Constraints**:
  - 🎥 *Movies*: Only recommends **Hindi (Bollywood)**
  - 📺 *WebSeries*: Only recommends **Hindi** and **K-Drama** content

✅ **Safe Input Validation** – Handles invalid inputs gracefully  
✅ **Scalable Design** – Easy to expand with new features like user history, ratings, etc.

## 💡 Learning Objectives

This project helps you learn and implement:

- 📁 Java **File I/O** – (`BufferedReader`, `FileReader`)
- 🧱 Custom Java classes with **OOP principles**
- 🔁 Clean logic with **loops**, **conditions**, and **filtering**
- 📋 Managing **lists**, **arrays**, and **user input validation**
- 🌍 Applying **real-world business constraints** (like language rules)

## 🛠️ Potential Extensions

Here are some ideas to take this project further:

🔢 Add **user ratings** or **popularity scores**  
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Support **multi-user profiles** and content history  
🌐 Connect to a **real-world API** (IMDb, TMDb) for dynamic content  
🖼️ Build a **GUI** using JavaFX or Swing for desktop users  
🌍 Convert it into a **REST API** using Spring Boot
