🎬📚 Recommendation System in Java
A console-based Recommendation Engine developed using core Java. This project allows users to explore personalized content suggestions (Movies, WebSeries, Books) based on genre and language preferences. The system uses a preloaded CSV dataset to simulate real-world recommendation filtering.

🎯 Ideal for beginners who want to learn Java concepts like file handling, object-oriented design, CLI interaction, and filtering logic.

✨ Features
✅ Dynamic CSV Parsing – Reads data directly from data.csv

✅ Robust CLI Interface – User-friendly command-line interaction

✅ Smart Filtering – Recommends content based on:

📂 Content Type – Choose from Books, Movies, WebSeries

🎭 Genre – E.g., Thriller, Romance, Comedy, etc.

🌐 Language Rules:

🎥 Movies: Only recommends Hindi (Bollywood)

📺 WebSeries: Only recommends Hindi and K-Drama content

✅ Safe Input Validation – Prevents invalid selections gracefully

✅ Scalable Design – Easily extendable to include ratings, multiple users, etc.

💡 Learning Objectives
Understand Java File I/O (BufferedReader, FileReader)

Practice creating and using custom Java classes

Implement clean loops, conditions, and filtering logic

Work with lists, arrays, and user input validation

Apply real-world constraints in logic (e.g., language-specific rules)



🛠️ Potential Extensions
Enhance the project with your own creative features:

🔢 Add user ratings or popularity scores

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Support multi-user profiles and history

🌐 Connect to a web API for live content

🖼️ Build a GUI using JavaFX or Swing

🌍 Convert into a REST API using Spring Boot
